This is a crawler I made for a digital marketing company I used to work for.

One of the tasks I had was checking manually for sudden drop off in our clients revenue which would indicate misconfiguration or removal of our JS tags from their site.
To improve efficiency of the process I made this crawler that would collect and store the relevant information in MongoDB.
